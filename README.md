### Functionality:

All functionare implemented as described. 

### Remarks:

Personnaly, I Prefer using CSS relatd to each component file in it's own directy subjectively. No particular Libs or thirt party CSS services have not been used in this project, instead, In-line css styling haev been used throw out the project.
About the description feedback: I would love you to be more specific on the backend URL for APIs since the URL of the GrpahQL server was given correcly but the URL which will take request was not specified. It's not a huge deal as developer can find the URL by debugging it throw dev tools "network" tab, however, for those who is new to GraphQl might take longer to figure out the correct API path.
