Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Functionality:

All functions are implemented as described. 

### Remarks:

Personnaly, I Prefer using CSS files related to each component file in it's own directy, subjectively. No particular Libs or thirt party CSS services have been used in this project, instead, In-line css styling have been used throw out the project.

Feedback about the description: The URL of the GrpahQL server was given correcly but the URL which will take request was not specified. I thought that was the API path as I am relatively newer to GraphQL but it's not a huge deal as developers can find the URL by debugging it throw dev tools "network" tab, however, for those who is new to GraphQL, as well as me, might take longer to figure out the correct what was going on.

Since there was no specific information about CORS error handling in the backend, I had to Proxy the server base_URL.
